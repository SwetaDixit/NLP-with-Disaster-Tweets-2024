# NLP with Disaster Tweets 2024

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on classifying disaster-related tweets. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## Description

Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in various applications, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and information retrieval. In this project, we specifically tackle the task of classifying tweets into two categories: disaster-related and non-disaster-related.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises tweets collected from various sources, with each tweet labeled as either a disaster tweet (1) or a non-disaster tweet (0). The dataset includes text features representing the content of each tweet, along with the corresponding labels.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise, such as special characters and stopwords, and performing tokenization and lemmatization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of classes, the length of tweets, and common words or phrases in disaster-related and non-disaster-related tweets.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as word embeddings or TF-IDF vectors, to represent the tweets numerically.
4. **Model Building**: Experiment with various machine learning models, including but not limited to logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers (e.g., BERT).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on the validation or test dataset.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models to improve their performance further.
7. **Inference**: Deploy the trained model(s) to make predictions on new or unseen tweets and assess their real-world performance.

## Requirements

To run the analysis and training scripts, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (for deep learning models)
- transformers (for transformer-based models)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow transformers
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to execute the analysis, train models, and make predictions.
